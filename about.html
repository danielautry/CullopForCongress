		<p>
			I’m a proud 4th generation Virginian born in Charlottesville to two educators. My parents both served our community as teachers, and my wife Ashley and I have built our family here.
 			<br><br>
			Hard work runs deep in the 5th. My grandfather worked for Norfolk Southern after serving in World War II, and my parents worked as teachers in Virginia and across the world to give us a good, middle-class life. <b>I’m running for Congress to make sure every Virginian has the same opportunity to succeed that I had</b>. 
  			<br><br>
			For too long, politicians in Washington have been more focused on partisanship than solutions. In my private sector career, I learned how to bring community and business leaders together to create good paying jobs. We need that kind of approach to bring a stronger economy, healthcare, and education to the district - not more political games from Washington. 
  			<br><br>
			This fight is personal for me. In 2014, our daughter Elizabeth was born severely premature and spent the first two months of her life in the hospital. Thanks to the amazing doctors and nurses at the UVA Hospital, Elizabeth is now a healthy and happy three-year-old and big sister to her brother Thomas. We were lucky, but my heart breaks to know that there are families across Virginia and America who are forced to declare bankruptcy when their child gets sick or hurt.   
  			<br><br>
			Virginians deserve someone who knows them and will fight for them - someone who will fight to give them opportunities to succeed, access to quality, affordable healthcare, and fight to ensure everyone has a quality education. 
  			<br><br>
			In the coming months, I’m going to be traveling across the 5th district to hear from you and talk about my ideas to give everyone an equal opportunity to succeed. I would be honored to have your support and serve you in Congress. I know that together, we can build a brighter future for Virginia.
