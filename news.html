			Ben Cullop Launches 5th District Campaign to Ensure All Virginians Have an Equal Opportunity to Succeed
			</h3>
			<p>
				EARLYSVILLE, VA – Today, Albemarle County Democrat and 4th generation Virginian <b>Ben Cullop</b> officially launched his campaign for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. His announcement included a biographical video that showed Cullop and citizens discussing the issues facing their community.
 				<br><br>
				“I’ve spoken to friends, family, and people across the district, and they have the same fears and frustrations I do about Washington,” <b>Cullop</b> said. “Special interests have stood in the way of progress on expanding job opportunities, providing better, more affordable healthcare, and ensuring every American has access to a high-quality education.”
 				<br><br>
				“Folks here feel are being left behind while Tom Garrett plays politics in Washington. It doesn’t have to be this way. I’ll use my leadership experience to get results in Congress and ensure every Virginian has the same chance to succeed that I did, no matter their race, gender or creed,” <b>Cullop</b> added. “After the terrorism in Charlottesville, the 5th district needs someone who is focused on unifying our community.”
 				<br><br>
				Cullop built a successful career and worked to bring community and business leaders together to create high paying jobs for Virginians. Currently, he serves on the UVA Children’s Hospital advisory board, the Albemarle County Police Foundation Board, and the Charlottesville Retirement Commission.
 				<br><br>
				Cullop’s announcement included a biographical video, called “Our Story,” which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3jMtToo3Y&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" style="color: gold;">here</a>.
 				<br><br>
				Cullop travelled the district to discuss residents and neighbors’ needs and concerns, as well as their visions for the future.
 				<br><br>
				“It’s very disheartening when we don’t feel like we’re being listened to or represented,” said Ronnie Haney of Appomattox County. “I know that’s not going to be you, Ben, because you’re from here and you will represent us and you’ll listen to us.”
 				<br><br>
				“The people of the 5th District of Virginia work hard and they love their family,” <b>Cullop</b> says in the video. “My story is their story.”

				Statement on the White Supremacist Violence in Charlottesville
			</h3>
			<p>
				I’m heartbroken for my hometown and our country.  This weekend’s acts of violence and words of hatred have no place in our discourse, and do not represent Virginia’s values or American values.  We all must denounce the hateful and divisive rhetoric shown today by white supremacists.  These are bigots who reject the fundamental American value that all are created equal.
				<br><br>
				We will not be divided by groups who would love nothing more than to make hatred and intolerance a mainstream value. Throughout the many years I’ve lived here, I have seen the values that truly represent our community: love, compassion, and unity.  Let us redouble our commitment to equality and opportunity for all, regardless of who might try to divide us.
				<br><br>
				My faith reminds me that we all have an obligation to respect and protect each other no matter who we are or where we come from.  I join everyone in our community in praying for the victims of today’s cowardly acts of violence and for the safety of all those standing against hatred.
